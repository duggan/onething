# one thing
Your time is valuable.

## Architectural

* Move to using verbs as part of entry namespace. Changes to all scripts required.
* Find better ways to chain the tools for common actions. Librarification may be necessary.
* CLI interface might work better if it resembles its data store, git.

## Features
* Archive page

## Product

* Resolve the question of whether having a verb/time matrix is a sensible direction. Does it break the concept of "one thing"?
* Is publishing time important? Should it be 3pm GMT (7am PDT, 10am EDT)?
* How important is consistency? Import enough to publish something less amazing or relevant if deadline approaches?
